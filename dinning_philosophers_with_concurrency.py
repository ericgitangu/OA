    Problem Type: Synchronization, Dining Philosophers Problem
    
    Problem Statement:
    The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem. It involves a certain number of philosophers sitting at a table, each with a plate of food and a fork on either side. A philosopher needs both forks to eat, but can only pick up one fork at a time. The problem is to design a protocol that the philosophers can use to avoid deadlock and starvation.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of philosophers.
    
    Methods:
    wants_to_eat(philosopher, pick_left_fork, pick_right_fork, eat, put_left_fork, put_right_fork): The method that simulates a philosopher wanting to eat.
    
    Example:
    philosophers = DiningPhilosophers(5)
    philosophers.wants_to_eat(0, pick_left_fork, pick_right_fork, eat, put_left_fork, put_right_fork)

    The Dining Philosophers problem:

       /  \        /  \
      F0   F1    F1   F2
     /        \ /        \
    P4        P2        P3
    \        / \        /
     F4   F3    F3   F4
       \  /        \  /
        P4          P3
    
    Each philosopher needs both forks to eat, but can only pick up one fork at a time.
    
    Approach:
    To ensure that all philosophers get a chance to eat and to avoid race conditions, we use the following approach:
    1. Each fork is represented by a threading.Lock() to ensure mutual exclusion when a philosopher picks up a fork.
    2. Philosophers always pick up the lower-numbered fork first to avoid deadlock. This means that if a philosopher's left fork has a lower number than their right fork, they will pick up the left fork first, and vice versa.
    3. We use a ThreadPoolExecutor to manage the concurrent execution of the philosophers' actions, ensuring that multiple philosophers can attempt to eat simultaneously without causing race conditions.
    4. The use of context managers (with statements) ensures that forks are properly acquired and released, maintaining thread safety.
